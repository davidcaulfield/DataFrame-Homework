# DataFrame-Homework
Pandas DataFrames have a method called ".memory_usage" which returns a pandas Series with column names as the index and memory usage of the columns in units of bytes. A pandas Series is simply a 1D array like object that has an array of data and index values.
Reducing memory usage in python is difficult because if you delete objects, then the memory is available to new Python objects, but not free()'d back to the system. In order to free the memory back to the system you must use "%reset Out" which will clear your history.
